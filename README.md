# Perfect Number
This program calculates which numbers entered by the user are perfect, but there's a twist. The program starts asking the user how many numbers are going to be entered. After that, this number is used to create an array which size is what the user entered. However, when the user starts informing the numbers that are going to be stored, the user can enter how many numbers he wants. The program will keep asking the user if he wants to continue. The key to not exceed the capacity of the vector here is to keep verifying if the current index is bigger than what the user entered initially. If it is, the index goes back to 0 and the numbers entered before will be replaced. This way, the program will only process the last **x** numbers the user entered, being **x** the number entered by the user initially.
